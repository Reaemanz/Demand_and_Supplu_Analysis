# Demand_and_Supplu_Analysis
The demand for a product or service is the quantity of that product or service the customers are willing to purchase at any given price during a particular period. And the supply for a product or service is the quantity the producers are willing to provide in the market at a particular price and a particular period.

Demand and Supply analysis means analyzing the relationship between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. It helps businesses understand the factors influencing consumer demand to maximize profits.

For the task of Demand and Supply analysis, we need a dataset based on demand for a product or service and supply for a product or service. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which is based on the demand for cab rides at a given time and the availability of drivers at a given time. You can download the dataset from here.
